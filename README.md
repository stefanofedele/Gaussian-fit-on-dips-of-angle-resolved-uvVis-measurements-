# Gaussian-fit-on-dips-of-angle-resolved-uvVis-measurements-
Gold nanostructured surfaces exhibit resonance phenomena between localized plasmonic waves and incoming light at visible spectral range. Angle resolved reflectance measurements provide peaks at wavelengths that depends on the angle of reflectance. A gaussian fit is necessary in order to properly find the dip position at each angle
